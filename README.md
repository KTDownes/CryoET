# CryoET
Repository for all the CryoET things I do. 

Includes using Nemo GPUs via OnDemand and sbatch commands.

I use these pipelines to reconstruct and investigate tomograms from milled lamella of epithelial cells. 

*Full disclosure I do not claim to be an expert, these are just the pipeline which work for me.*
